A key feature of Eleventy (11ty) is its extensibility through plugins. As long as those plugins are first party (such as `@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight`) there should be little trouble over time. But if plugins are from the community (such as `@jgarber/eleventy-plugin-markdown`) there is a concern about how long they may be maintained.

This concern makes me hesitant to use any plugins that haven't been maintained for a long while by dedicated programmers. So I'm just fine with the likes of `tailwind`, `cssnano`, and `postcss`. But there are other, potential useful, plugins that I'll choose to avoid.
