After moving my blog from WordPress to Jekyll to Hugo, I came to better appreciate the need to write markdown that is independent of the system used to create a blog. That may mean forgoing a special feature in one system, but if (when) that markdown file is going to run though another blogging engine, the effort will be worth it.

Some custom code will be needed to convert from one directory structure to another.
